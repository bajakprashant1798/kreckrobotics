    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Kreck Robotics</strong>, and its subsidiaries or Parent Companies (collectively “Kreck Robotics”) are committed to protecting your privacy and providing you with a positive experience on our websites and in using our products and services (“Solution” or “Solutions”).
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      This Privacy Statement applies to Kreck Robotics websites and Solutions that link to or reference this Statement and describes how we handle personal information and the choices available to you regarding collection, use, access, and how to update and correct your personal information. Additional information on our personal information practices may be provided in offer descriptions, supplemental privacy statements, or notices provided prior to or at the time of data collection. Certain Kreck Robotics parent or subsidiary websites may have their own privacy statement that describes how we handle personal information for those websites specifically. To the extent a notice provided at the time of collection or a website or Solution specific privacy statement conflict with this Privacy Statement, such specific notice or supplemental privacy statement will control.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-3">Collection of Your Personal Information</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">
      We may collect data, including personal, device information, about you as you use our websites and Solutions and interact with us. “Personal information” is any information that can be used to identify an individual, and may include name, address, email address, phone number, login information (account number, password), marketing preferences, social media account information, or payment card number. If we link other data with your personal information, we will treat that linked data as personal information. We also collect personal information from trusted third-party sources and engage third parties to collect personal information to assist us.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">We collect personal information for a variety of reasons, such as:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
      <li>Processing your order, including payment transactions.</li>
      <li>Providing you with a newsletter subscription.</li>
      <li>Sending marketing communications.</li>
      <li>Creating an account.</li>
      <li>Enabling the use of certain features of our Solutions.</li>
      <li>Personalising your experience.</li>
      <li>Providing customer service.</li>
      <li>Managing a job application.</li>
      <li>Collecting information during the testing admissions process when a computer-based certification test is administered to you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-2">
      We and the third parties we engage may combine the information we collect from you over time and across our websites and Solutions with information obtained from other sources. This helps us improve its overall accuracy and completeness, and also helps us better tailor our interactions with you.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      If you choose to provide Kreck Robotics with a third party’s personal information (such as name, email, and phone number), you represent that you have the third party’s permission to do so. Examples include forwarding reference or marketing material to a friend or sending job referrals. Third parties may unsubscribe from any future communication following the link provided in the initial message. In some instances, Kreck Robotics and the third parties we engage may automatically collect data through cookies, web logs, web beacons, and other similar applications. This information is used to better understand and improve the usability, performance, and effectiveness of the website and to help tailor content or offers for you.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      When you use parts of the Service that require Hardware, we may collect Information from that Hardware, such as model and serial number, Hardware activity logs, and historic and current Hardware configuration. We also collect usage data from your Hardware, such as what devices are plugged into the Hardware, the location of the Hardware, whether Hardware is in dimmable mode or is in use, and how much electricity is being consumed by devices plugged into any Hardware.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-3">Uses of Your Personal Information</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      We intend to protect the personal information entrusted to us and treat it securely in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Kreck Robotics implements physical, administrative, and technical safeguards designed to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, use, or disclosure. We also contractually require that our suppliers protect such information from unauthorised access, use, and disclosure.

    <p class="mb-4">

    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-3">Use of Cookies and other Web Technologies</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Like many websites, Kreck Robotics uses automatic data collection tools, such as cookies, embedded web links, and web beacons. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our website. Examples include your browser type and the address of the website from which you arrived at our website.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
      <li>Your Internet Protocol (IP) address. This is a number automatically assigned to your computer or device whenever you connect to the Internet. It is a unique address assigned by your Internet service provider or IT department on a TCP/IP network. Among other things, the IP address allows web servers to locate and identify your device.</li>
      <li>Clickstream behaviour. This includes, for example, the pages you view and the links you click. These tools help make your visit to our website easier, more efficient, and more valuable by providing you with a customised experience and recognising you when you return.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a “do not track” feature that sends signals to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different from blocking or deleting cookies, as browsers with a “do not track” feature enabled may still accept cookies.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      No industry standard currently exists on how companies should respond to “do not track” signals, although one may develop in the future. Kreck Robotics websites do not currently recognise and respond to “do not track” signals. If we do in the future, we will describe how in this Privacy Statement. Learn more information about “do not track”.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      We partner with third parties to display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partners may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you with advertising based on your browsing activities and interests. You may opt out of this advertising.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-3">Linked Websites</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      We may provide links to other third-party websites and services that are outside our control and not covered by this Privacy Statement. We encourage you to review the privacy statements posted on those websites (and all websites) you visit.

    <p class="mb-4">
      If you participate in a discussion forum, local communities, or chat room on a Kreck Robotics website, you should be aware that the information you provide there (i.e. your public profile) will be made broadly available to others, and could be used to contact you, send you unsolicited messages, or for purposes neither Kreck Robotics nor you have control over. Also, please recognise that individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and conditions. Kreck Robotics is not responsible for the personal information or any other information you choose to submit in these forums. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <NuxtLink href="mailto:kreckrobotics@gmail.com" class="text-[#dc2223] underline">kreckrobotics@gmail.com</NuxtLink> In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-3">Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Kreck Robotics encourages parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities. Kreck Robotics does not knowingly collect personal information from children without appropriate parental or guardian consent.
